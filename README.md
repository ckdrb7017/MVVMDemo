# Description
   
    There are two tracklist tabs: a tracklist tab and a tight list tab.
    The tracklist sprays data from the server.
    The code has been configured so that the paging function can be performed together.
    
    The compact list is displayed as a built-in device when the star is clicked on the tracklist.
    Press the star again to delete it from the internal device.
    
    Also, the steaming list on the track list was marked in yellow.
