# Description
   
    There are two tracklist tabs: a tracklist tab and a favoritelist tab.
    The tracklist sprays data from the server.
    The code has been configured so that the paging function can be performed together.
    
    The favoritelist is displayed as a built-in device when the star is clicked on the tracklist.
    Press the star again to delete it from the internal device.
    Also, the track was marked in yellow on the tracklist.
